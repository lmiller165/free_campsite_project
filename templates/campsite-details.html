            <p>Free camping, no permit needed. Roughly 10 sites spaced apart nicely with two in a cul de sac that could accommodate at total of 5-8 rigs. Two very clean vault toilets are centrally located. Also be sure to follow the posted signs regarding having a fires in a metal container. The area is patrolled regularly by CA Park Rangers, who are cool but heavily armed. Don't mess with them. Since the area is so quiet, you might hear traffic driving pass on S22.</p>

          <p>Nice well spaced out campsites in sandy hills with lots of wild flowers at the moment. Good 2wd access.</p>

          <p>As stated by other visitors, great place with vault toilet. FREE. I did pass the entrance eastbound and had to loo back to road and campsite sign post.</p>

          <p>Just as described. FYI- coordinates seem to be for an actual campsite rather than the entrance. You may drive by it but youâ€™ll realize it right away</p>
