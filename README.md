## Overview
**Description**  
Roam for Free (previously named "Free Camping Project") is a full-stack web application that allows users to add points to a map where they have previously stayed overnight for free. Anyone is able to view the uploaded campsites and use them to build an off-the-grid trip of their own. After someone has stayed at any given campsite they will also be able to add reviews and ratings for each spot.
